# Quick Start

## Step 1: Add the Marketplace

Add this marketplace to Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add bugster-claude-marketplace
```

This makes all plugins available for installation, but does not load any agents or tools into your context.

## Step 2: Install Plugins

Browse available plugins:

```
/plugin
```

Install the plugins you need. You’ll then need to restart Claude Code in order to use the new plugin.
